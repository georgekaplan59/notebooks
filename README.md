# Notebooks

Some Jupyter notebooks to analyse some issues:

* how to estimate probabilities using Montecarlo simulations
* how to count sets using combinatorics
* how to know when a draw can lead to a dead end using graph theory
* how to apply generators and recursion to avoid memory overflows
* when and how to calculate exactly the probabilities of a draw using ideas taken from game theory
* why is better adding logarithms than multiplying very tiny numbers
* when is it crucial to apply the right data type to achieve the precision required by our calculation
* how to measure the representativeness of a _proportional_ electoral system (in Spanish)
* how to increase the proportionality of the Spanish Electoral Law.
* how the electoral formula changes the disproportionality indexes of a proportional electoral system.
