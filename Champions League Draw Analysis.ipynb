    "> _The draw for the round of 16 of the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League involves all the clubs that qualified from the group stage. This round will be played according to the knockout system... The draw will take place in accordance with the following conditions: group winners will be drawn against the runners-up; clubs from the same association cannot be drawn against each other; group winners must be drawn against runners-up from different group; the runners-up play the first leg at home. Each of the eight pairings will be determined by drawing one of the runners-up first then one of the eligible group winners the eight-balls containing the names of the runners-up are placed in one ball while the balls containing the names of the opponents are picked from the eight different group winner spots and placed into another ball. the computer will indicate after drawing each runner-up which group winners can be drawn in accordance with the conditions explained should we have only one team eligible to be drawn against a particular runner-up there will be no draw and the two teams will be paired. This procedure is repeated for all the eight pairings._\n",

    "To reproduce the very same steps of the draw in the Montecarlo simulation, dead ends must be avoided before they occur. This can be achieved by applying an additional filter to the candidates clubs from winners pot. The functions `remove_winners_leading_to_dead_ends` and `exist_maximum_matching` implement this by means of [bipartite graphs](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.bipartite.html) and [maximum matching algorithm](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.bipartite.html?highlight=bipartite#module-networkx.algorithms.bipartite.matching) from `networkx` package."
