    "UEFA said \"further restrictions will be announced ahead of the draw\". So, for the time being we can assume the technical explanations for 2016-2017 round of 16 draw by Michael Heselschwerdt (UEFA Head of Club Competitions):\n",
    "\n",
    "> _The draw for the round of 16 of the 2016-17 UEFA Champions League involves all the clubs that qualified from the group stage. This round will be played according to the knockout system... The draw will take place in accordance with the following conditions: group winners will be drawn against the runners-up; clubs from the same association cannot be drawn against each other; group winners must be drawn against runners-up from different group; the runners-up play the first leg at home. Each of the eight pairings will be determined by **drawing one of the runners-up first then one of the eligible group winners**. The eight-balls containing the names of the runners-up are placed in one ball while the balls containing the names of the opponents are picked from the eight different group winner spots and placed into another ball. **The computer will indicate after drawing each runner-up which group winners can be drawn in accordance with the conditions explained**. Should we have only one team eligible to be drawn against a particular runner-up there will be no draw and the two teams will be paired. This procedure is repeated for all the eight pairings._\n",

If we add the constraint about the group of the previous stage, there will be 8 options for the first runner-up drawn, 7 for their rival in the winners pot, 7 teams for the second runner-up drawn and so on. That is $8\\times 7!^2 = 203,212,800$. After adding the association constraint, there will be fewer outcomes. Nevertheless, it might take about 12 hours to process all of them because one million draws requires 4 minutes, according to our measurements (Intel&reg; Core&trade; i5 CPU @ 2.67GHz). Therefore, this calculation is in the edge of being computationally manageable.

Each tree path represents a draw where the nodes below the root node are the runners-up drawn firstly and the leaf nodes are the winners drawn lastly. A probability is assigned to each edge according to the number of the possible outcomes available in that point (that is, the number of children nodes). The probability of a concrete draw (i.e., a tree path) will be the product of the probabilities assigned to its edges. The probability of a fixture will be the sum of the probabilities of each draw in which it occurs."

    "\n",
    "Montecarlo simulation is the fastest and most accurate method to estimate probabilities in a draw. However, the simulations should carefully replicate the actual process being modeled. Otherwise they can produce misleading results. In our case, a naîve design of the Montecarlo simulation leaded to a result equivalent to assume an uniform distribution among feasible draw outcomes. This simplified the code, but, as the results shown, it was wrong. Although an exact calculation is always possible, we must know in advance how much time it would take to execute our code. In a slightly complex or underconstrained case, it could take days, months or even years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating probabilities for a sport draw could seem a toy example or a waste of time. On the contrary, I think this notebook reveals that it is a great example for applying methods from discrete mathematics, statistics, game theory and computer science. How to count sets using combinatorics? How to know when a draw can lead to a dead end using graph theory? How to estimate probabilities using Montecarlo simulations? How to apply generators and recursion to avoid memory overflows? When and how to calculate exactly the probabilities of a draw using ideas taken from game theory? Why is better adding logarithms than multiplying very tiny numbers? When is it crucial to apply the right data type to achieve the precision required by our calculation?"
